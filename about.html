        <p>Hello there, thanks for using this tool!<br><br><br><br>
            First off, I wanna say that this is my first experience at making and programming. This is my first experience with programming even! For a long time, I have been wanting to explore this field, and see what it has to offer for me, and in turn, what I had to offer for others. That's why I decided to make this website. I felt like creating this tool would make it a lot easier for people to keep their progress sorted out (trust me, I was close to printing and coloring the maps myself). In need of such a tool, I decided that this was the time to start learning how to write code.<br><br><br>
            I explicitly didn't want to use any webpage development software, as I wanted to test the waters with actual programming from scratch. While a lot of errors and mistakes were made on the way, even if it seems like that'd be unlikely for such a simple website, I managed to create something that I am content with, and I hope that people would actually find worth it to use in their gameplay.<br><br><br>
            As for right now, I plan on updating this site every so often to include and change content that I still feel needs to be refined. If you want to give any feedback or suggestions for me to consider adding to the website, please click the "Feedback" text down below.<br><br><br>
            Thanks to several people, forums and online schools for helping me figure things out during my learning process, and thank you again for checking out this little project of mine. &#60;3</p>
